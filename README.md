Python projects

This project was a capstone for the USC course ITP 216, Applied Python.
It uses most of the concepts learned in the class, including basic web development in Flask, data manipulation and analysis in Numpy and Pandas, data visualization in Matplotlib, and basic machine learning in scikit-learn.

Using a publicly available dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/housing-price-dataset), this code creates a web app which charts housing prices based on a range of years they were built, and allows the user to input four dimensions (sqft, # of beds, # of baths, and year built) with which the app will predict a market price.
